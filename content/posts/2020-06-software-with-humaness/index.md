> The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste. They have absolutely no taste, and I don’t mean that in a small way, I mean that in a big way, in the sense that they don’t think of original ideas, and they don’t bring much culture into their product. \

—Steve Jobs, 1995 \

Now, I don't know if this is still true of Microsoft or if Jobs would consider this still to be true, nor is that the reason this quotation grabbed my attention.

It grabbed my attention because I want to build software that is imbued with aspects of its creator. I think it makes a user's subsequent experience with that software better. It makes the experience less sterile, more forgiving, and more enjoyable.
